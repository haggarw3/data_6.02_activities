# 6.02 Activity 1

In this activity, you will be using data from `files_for_activities/sample_superstore.xls`. Please answer the following questions using Tableau.

- Create a new workbook for the activity.
- To connect to multiple tables in a single data source at one time, what must be specified?
    a. A blend
    b. A calculation
    c. A join
    d. A hierarchy
- Tableau can create worksheet-specific filters.
    a. True
    b. False
    
- Create a join between the tables `orders` and `returns`, such that this time you have the data for the products that were not returned.
  Hint: After you create the join between the tables, you would need to add filter. Think about what kind of join would do the job here. If the order was returned there would be a match between `Order ID` in the `Orders` table and `Order ID` in the `Returns` table. For the orders in the `Orders` table that were not returned, those `Order ID` will not be present in the `Returns` table
  
  
- Filter out the data for `2017` and find the the percent of total `Sales` for _Home Office_ Customer Segment?
  Hint: To filter the data for 2017, either you can create a calculated field as discussed in the lesson or you can use a filter directly on the sheet by adding order date in the filter pane. To find the percent of total `Sales`, use a quick table calculation

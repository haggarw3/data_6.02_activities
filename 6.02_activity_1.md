# 6.02 Activity 1

In this activity, you will be using data from `files_for_activities/sample_superstore.xls`. Please answer the following questions using Tableau.

- Create a new workbook for the activity.
- To connect to multiple tables in a single data source at one time, what must be specified?
   a. A blend
   b. A calculation
   c. A join
   d. A hierarchy
- Tableau can create worksheet-specific filters.
    a. True
    b. False
- Create a join between the tables `orders` and `returns`, such that this time you have the data for the products that were not returned.
  Hint: After you create the join between the tables, you would need to add filter. Think about what kind of join would do the job here.
- Filter out the data for `2017` and find the the percent of total Sales for _Home Office_ Customer Segment?
  Hint: To filter the data for 2017, either you can create a calculated field as discussed in the lesson or you can use a filter directly on the sheet by adding order date in the filter pane as shown.
